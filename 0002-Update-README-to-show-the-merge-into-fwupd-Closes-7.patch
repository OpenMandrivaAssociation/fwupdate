 ## Normal flow
 UEFI capsule updates are _not_ actually flashed within Linux.  They're staged for update to
 be installed on the next boot.

 ## Usage
 UEFI capsule updates are typically distributed by services such as [LVFS](https://fwupd.org) in _.CAB_ format.  The command line tool provided by this project works directly on the
